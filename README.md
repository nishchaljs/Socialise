# Socialise | Social Network App for physically challenged

Every person has an equal right to information and impairments shouldnâ€™t restrict people from gaining this information. So, the main motive here is to make social media application, which is a source of information, more accessible to the blind,deaf and dumb. Provisions have to me made keeping in mind their difficulties and interests.
